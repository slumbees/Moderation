welcome to my premade moderation bot code! this is only operated for python language!
there are basic commands in here, including a print, purge, kick, ban, latency & permissions set for kicking.

1. do pip install discord.py
2. python -m pip install discord.py
3. install python via extensions (there will be 2 of them, install both of them)
4. be sure you already have a application and bot made


these codes are premade by slumber#9279, all work goes to her and only her!!

if you'd like a custom bot made for you, contact slumbee@tutanota.com via e-mail for pricing and negotiations
